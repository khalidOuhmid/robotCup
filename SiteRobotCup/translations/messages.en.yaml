  welcome: "Welcome to the RoboCup"
  presentation: "The RoboCup is a competition, but above all it is a community, and participants interact throughout the event. 
                    Many technologies developed by competitors are open.
                    Each RoboCup is also the occasion for an International Symposium, a major venue for the presentation and discussion of scientific contributions.
                    addressing a wide range of areas relating to research and teaching in robotics and artificial intelligence. 
                    To encourage the greatest possible sharing of knowledge
                    on both hardware and software aspects, a specific axis of the Symposium focuses on “open” (open source) developments."
